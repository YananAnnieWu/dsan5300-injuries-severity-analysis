## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to investigate the injury side of fatal crashes by conducting a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a nationwide dataset. We examined how time patterns, spatial distributions, road characteristics, environmental conditions, and accident structures correlate with the number of injuries per incident. Building on these findings, we applied a range of statistical learning techniques: supervised methods including Support Vector Machines (SVM), LDA & QDA, Random Forests and Neural Network with hyperparameter tuning, and unsupervised methods such as correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

Our goal is to uncover meaningful patterns that could help inform better traffic safety strategies, emergency response plans, and preventive interventions aimed at minimizing injury impacts.
